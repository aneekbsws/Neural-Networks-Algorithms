# deeplearning
Deep Learning codes (basically diving deep into algorithms behind the neural networks)
Contents:
1. Logistic Regression Algorithm (recognising a cat image)
2. A shallow neural network algorithm (clustering points based on binary classification - in a floral shape)
3. A deep neural network algorithm (again, recognising a cat image)
4. Improving neural networks - initialization (Using Xavier and He initialization to improve the learning of the model)
5. Improving neural networks - regularization (Using L2 Regularization and Dropout method)
6. Improving neural networks - gradient-optimizer (Using mini-batch sizing, momentum/adam optimization and learning rate decay methods)
